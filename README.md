# HESS-EMS-SIM

A simulation framework to test and showcase energy management strategies
(EMS) for hybrid energy storage systems (HESS) defined in
[HESS-EMS](https://github.com/s-guenther/hessems).


## Associated Work

Paper: _forthcoming_ \
EMS Implementations: [HESS-EMS](https://github.com/s-guenther/hessems)

To showcase the EMS, the project makes use of
[ESTSS](https://github.com/s-guenther/estss) and
[hybrid](https://github.com/s-guenther/hybrid).
Note that explicit dependencies on these projects are absent. Utilised 
time series data from `ESTSS` is included in this project, and manually
generated reference data from `hybrid` is also stored here, allowing for result
reproduction without dependencies. The introduced EMS can be operated
independently, and testing and visualizing other time series and EMS without
`ESTSS` and `hybrid` is feasible.


## Overview

The main modules to simulate an EMS are:

- `controllers.py` provides adapters for the EMS defined in
  [HESS-EMS](https://github.com/s-guenther/hessems)
- `storages.py` provides the storage implementation
- `simulate.py` for simulating specific storage settings with specific 
  controllers

To showcase the EMS, the `examples/` folder contains

- `timeseries.py` for data retrieval from
  [ESTSS](https://github.com/s-guenther/estss)
- `reference.py` for data export and import to/from
  [hybrid](https://github.com/s-guenther/hybrid)
- `visualize.py` for standardized simulation results visualization
- `showcase.py` for setting up the concrete EMS simulations and generating 
  the plots

See the source code documentation for further information.

## Requirements

Developed with Python `3.11`. Should work with way older versions since
`3.6` (f-strings) as well.


## Installation

Install manually by cloning the repository, entering it, and build and 
install via the `pyproject.toml`:

```shell
    git clone https://github.com/s-guenther/hessemssim
    cd hessemssim
    python3 -m build
    pip install .
```
